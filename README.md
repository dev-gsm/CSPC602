#### Beam Search Algorithm

- Beam search is a heuristic search algorithm that explores a graph by expanding the most optimistic node in a limited set. Beam search is an optimization of best-first search that reduces its memory requirements.

- Best-first search is a graph search that orders all partial solutions according to some heuristic. But in beam search, only a predetermined number of best partial solutions are kept as candidates. Therefore, it is a greedy algorithm.

- Beam search uses breadth-first search to build its search tree. At each level of the tree, it generates all successors of the states at the current level, sorting them in increasing order of heuristic cost. However, it only stores a predetermined number (Î²), of best states at each level called the beamwidth. Only those states are expanded next.


```{algorithm}
Start 
Take the inputs 
NODE = Root_Node & Found = False
If : Node is the Goal Node,
     Then Found = True, 
Else : 
     Find SUCCs of NODE if any, with its estimated cost&
     store it in OPEN List 
While (Found == false & not able to proceed further), do
{
     Sort OPEN List
     Select top W elements from OPEN list and put it in
     W_OPEN list and empty the OPEN list.
     for each NODE from W_OPEN list
     {
         if NODE = Goal,
             then FOUND = true 
         else
             Find SUCCs of NODE. If any with its estimated
             cost & Store it in OPEN list
     }
}
If FOUND = True,
    then return Yes
else
    return No
Stop
